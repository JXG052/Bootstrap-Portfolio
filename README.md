# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
This is home to a personal portfolio of my work, built using Bootstrap as per the Module 3 Challenge of EDX bootcamp. It's purpose is to act as a home page for anyone interested in my work, ideally, potential clients and employers. The page aims to meet all the acceptance criteria required for the challenge, whilst simultaneously adding my own style and ensuring the page is responsive, Ã  la what I learnt in Week 3 of the Front-End bootcamp.
